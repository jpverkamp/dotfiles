# NAME
#    Wc - recursive version of the wc command
#
# SYNOPSIS
#    Wc [-c][-l][-w] [file | directory ...]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#    This is a recursive version of the wc command.  This
#    command counts the lines, words,and characters in the
#    files similar to the wc command, however, this command
#    also searches subdirectories for files to include in
#    the counts.
#
#    If a file name on the command line contains wildcard
#    characters, it must be quoted so that the wildcard
#    characters can be processed inside this shell script
#    rather than being expanded into file names on the
#    command line.  For example:
#
#         Wc "directory/*.c"
#
#    will search "directory" and its subdirectories for
#    files that end in ".c" and count the lines, words, and
#    characters in those files.
#
#    -c    Count characters
#
#    -l    Count lines
#
#    -w    Count words
#
# RETURN VALUE
#    0    Successful completion
#    1    Usage error
